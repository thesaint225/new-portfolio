Shopping Cart System
Description: Build a shopping cart application where users can browse through a product catalog, add items to their cart, view cart totals, and remove items from the cart. Users should be able to apply discount codes to their total.

Key Features:

Array & Object: Use arrays and objects to represent products (e.g., name, price, quantity) and the shopping cart.
Functions, Scope & Execution Context: Create functions for adding/removing items to/from the cart, calculating totals, and applying discounts.
Logic & Control Flow: Implement logic to handle cases like empty carts, invalid discount codes, and applying quantity limits.
Loops, Iteration & Higher-Order Methods: Use loops and methods like reduce() to calculate totals, and forEach() to list products.
DOM Manipulation: Dynamically update the product catalog and shopping cart using JavaScript to add, remove, or modify items.
Event Handling: Handle events like adding products to the cart, applying discount codes, and updating product quantities.
Extensions:

Implement a feature to calculate shipping costs based on the number of items in the cart.
Add a "Wishlist" feature where users can save items for later.
Save the cart to local storage so that the cart persists when the page is reloaded.
